# Hi, I'm Sleepdealer

I program stuff sometimes and make keyboards work

This website was made with Flask and Jinja, with a Postgres DB. All the text is written in markdown. If you'd like to know more about the site, you can read my post about it at <https://sleepdealer.xyz/article/site%20breakdown>.

My apologies for the lack of posts on the site, I'm trying to add to it :D

Thanks for visiting my site, I really appreciate it. I hope you enjoy it
